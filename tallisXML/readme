tallisXML folder

This folder holds the database mapping files for tallis. It is live on the server.

To get tallis to use this mapping file, ensure NO tasks/boxes are selected in the Tallis Composer, then on the left
yellow window, click on 'MetaProps' tab.

Under 'Common Meta Properties', add the following:
folio.xmldbmapper.mapping=../../../../../www/3yp/tallisXML/coldOrFlu.xml

The filename will change dependent on which XML file you need to access.


REMEMBER: You need to use our enactment server, NOT cossacs!
